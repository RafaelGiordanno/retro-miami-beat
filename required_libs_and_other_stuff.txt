This project requires LibGDX. Specifically these libs:
- gdx.jar
- gdx-audio.jar
- gdx-audio-natives.jar
- gdx-backend-lwjgl.jar
- gdx-backend-lwjgl-natives.jar
- gdx-freetype.jar
- gdx-freetype.natives.jar
- gdx-natives.jar

This source code is not reusable. Probably more than half of it is hard coded.
I ~~really~~ do not recommend using it.
Third party assets (fonts) are free to use for personal projects.
